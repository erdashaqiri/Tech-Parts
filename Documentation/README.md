# Project outline

Project Title: TechParts PC Components Online Store

Project Description: We created TechParts as a responsive e-commerce website specializing in computer hardware components. The platform features product listings across multiple categories, a shopping cart system, and a user-friendly dark/light mode toggle. Our goal was to build an intuitive online store that simplifies the process of finding and purchasing PC components for both casual users and experienced builders.

Technologies Used: The project was built using semantic HTML5 for structure, CSS with Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts, and vanilla JavaScript for all interactive features including cart management and theme switching and incorporated Font Awesome icons for visual elements.
